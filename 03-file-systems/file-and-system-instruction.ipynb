    "What is a Context Manager?\n",
    "A context manager is a Python construct that allows for the setup and teardown of resources automatically. It ensures that resources are properly acquired and released, even if errors occur during their use. Common resources managed by context managers include files, network connections, and locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Do Context Managers Work?\n",
    "Context managers define two essential methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "__enter__(): Acquired at the beginning of the with block. It sets up the resource and returns it.\n",
    "__exit__(): Invoked at the end of the with block, regardless of whether the block was exited normally or via an exception. It handles the teardown, such as closing a file.\n",
    "The with statement simplifies the use of these methods, providing a clean syntax for resource management."
